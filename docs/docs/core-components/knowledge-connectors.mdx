<!--
Proposed plan to reorganize the knowledge content again:

About knowledge: Easier way to rename index?

Ingest knowledge (existing page)
Connector setup will be moved to a different page.
See also: Configure connectors, browse and manage knowledge
TBD: Supported file types

Configure ingestion (new page)
Knowledge ingestion settings (reorg/cleanup)
Don't recommend unsupported models. Enable models thru the settings page only.
See also: Configure connectors

Configure connectors (new page)
Oauth mode
Cloud storage connector setup
TBD: disconnector/reconnect connectors, better separation of Oauth providers vs cloud storage access
See also: About knowledge, ingest knowledge
Related tasks: Check all links to the 3 existing pages, check all anchors and sections without dedicated anchors, check nav titles in sidebar.js.
