title: Invoke OpenRAG with uvx
slug: /install-uvx

For guided configuration and simplified service management, install OpenRAG with services managed by the [Terminal User Interface (TUI)](/tui).

You can use [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/#running-tools) to invoke OpenRAG outside of a Python project or without modifying your project's dependencies.

:::tip
The [automatic installer script](/install) also uses `uvx` to install OpenRAG.
:::

Depending on your project structure, `uvx` might not be suitable for production deployments.
For other installation methods, see [Choose an installation method](/install-options).

## Install and run OpenRAG with uvx

    1. Create a directory to store your OpenRAG configuration files and data, and then change to that directory:

       ```bash
       mkdir openrag-workspace
       cd openrag-workspace
       ```

       :::tip
       If you want to use a pre-populated [`.env`](/reference/configuration) file for OpenRAG, copy it to this directory before invoking OpenRAG.
       :::

    2. Invoke OpenRAG:
       ```bash
       uvx openrag
       ```

       You can invoke a specific version using any of the [`uvx` version specifiers](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/#requesting-specific-versions), such as `--from`:

       ```bash
       uvx --from openrag==0.1.30 openrag
       ```

Invoking OpenRAG with `uvx openrag` creates a cached, ephemeral environment for the TUI in your local `uv` cache.
By invoking OpenRAG in a specific directory, your OpenRAG configuration files and data are stored separately from the `uv` cache.
Clearing the `uv` cache doesn't remove your entire OpenRAG installation.
After clearing the cache, you can re-invoke OpenRAG (`uvx openrag`) to restart the TUI with your preserved configuration and data.

If you encounter errors during installation, see [Troubleshoot OpenRAG](/support/troubleshoot).

## Set up OpenRAG with the TUI

When the Terminal User Interface (TUI) starts, you must complete the initial setup to configure OpenRAG.

![OpenRAG TUI Interface](@site/static/img/OpenRAG_TUI_2025-09-10T13_04_11_757637.svg)

The OpenRAG setup process creates the `.env` and `docker-compose.yml` files in the directory where you invoked OpenRAG.
If it detects a `.env` file in the OpenRAG installation directory, it sources any variables from that file.
