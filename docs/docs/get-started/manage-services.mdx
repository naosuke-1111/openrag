Service management is an essential part of maintaining your OpenRAG deployment.

Most OpenRAG services run in containers.

_Native services_, like Docling, run directly on the local machine where you installed OpenRAG.

## Manage containers and services with the TUI {#tui-container-management}

If you [installed OpenRAG](/install-options) with the automated installer script, `uv`, or `uvx`, you can use the [Terminal User Interface (TUI)](/tui) to manage your services:

* Start and stop OpenRAG container-based services.
* Start and stop OpenRAG's native services (Docling).
* View the status of your OpenRAG services.
* Access container logs for troubleshooting.
* Upgrade your OpenRAG containers to the latest version.
* Reset your OpenRAG containers to an initial state (destructive).

### Diagnostics

The **Diagnostics** menu provides health monitoring for your container runtimes and monitoring of your OpenSearch security.

### Status {#status}

The TUI's **Status** menu provides information about your OpenRAG services, including health, ports, logs, and controls:

* **Logs**: To view streaming logs, select the container you want to view, and press <kbd>l</kbd>.
To copy the logs, click **Copy to Clipboard**.

* **Upgrade**: Check for updates to OpenRAG. For more information, see [upgrade OpenRAG](/upgrade).

* **Factory Reset**: This is a destructive action that [resets your containers](#reset-containers).

* **Native services**: [View and manage OpenRAG's native services](#start-all-services) that run directly on the local machine instead of a container.

### Reset containers {#reset-containers}

Reset your OpenRAG deployment by recreating the containers and removing some related data.

:::warning
This is a destructive action that destroys the following:

* All OpenRAG containers, volumes, and local images
* Any additional Docker objects
* The contents of OpenRAG's `config` and `./opensearch-data` directories
* The `conversations.json` file

This operation _doesn't_ remove the `.env` file or the contents of the `./openrag-documents` directory.
:::

1. To destroy and recreate your OpenRAG containers, go to the TUI [**Status** menu](#status), and then click **Factory Reset**.

   This function runs the following commands _and_ deletes the contents of OpenRAG's `config` and `./opensearch-data` directories.

   ```bash
   docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans --rmi local
   docker system prune -f
   ```

2. If you reset your containers as part of reinstalling OpenRAG, continue the [reinstallation process](/reinstall) after resetting the containers.
Otherwise, in the TUI **Setup** menu, repeat the [setup process](#setup) to start the services and launch the OpenRAG app. Your OpenRAG passwords, OAuth credentials (if previously set), and onboarding configuration are restored from the `.env` file.

### Start all services {#start-all-services}

Through the TUI, you can stop and start OpenRAG services.

#### Start containers

On the TUI main page or the **Setup** menu, click **Start All Services** to start the OpenRAG containers.

When you start all services, the following processes happen:

1. OpenRAG automatically detects your container runtime, and then checks if your machine has compatible GPU support by checking for `CUDA`, `NVIDIA_SMI`, and Docker/Podman runtime support. This check determines which Docker Compose file OpenRAG uses.

2. OpenRAG pulls the OpenRAG container images with `docker compose pull` if any images are missing.

3. OpenRAG deploys the containers with `docker compose up -d`.

#### Start native services (Docling)

A _native service_ in OpenRAG is a service that runs locally on your machine, not within a container. For example, the `docling serve` process is an OpenRAG native service because this document processing service runs on your local machine, separate from the OpenRAG containers.

From the **Status** menu, you can view the status, port, and process ID (PID) of the OpenRAG native services.
You can also click **Stop** or **Restart** to stop and start OpenRAG native services.

## Manage containers with Docker or Podman

If you [deployed OpenRAG with self-managed containers](/docker), run Docker or Podman commands to manage your OpenRAG containers.

* Start containers
* Stop containers
* View container status
* Access container logs for troubleshooting
* Upgrade your OpenRAG containers to the latest version
* Reset your OpenRAG containers to an initial state (destructive)
