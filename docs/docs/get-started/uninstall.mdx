:::tip
If you want to reset your OpenRAG containers without removing OpenRAG entirely, see [Reset OpenRAG containers](/manage-services) and [Reinstall OpenRAG](/reinstall).
:::

If you used the [automated installer script](/install) or [`uvx`](/install-uvx) to install OpenRAG, clear your `uv` cache (`uv cache clean`) to remove the TUI environment, and then delete the directory containing your OpenRAG configuration files and data (where you would invoke OpenRAG).

If you used [`uv`](/install-uv) to install OpenRAG, run `uv remove openrag` in your Python project.

For self-managed containers, destroy the containers, prune any additional Docker objects, and delete any remaining OpenRAG files, as explained in [Reset OpenRAG containers](/manage-services).
